# ssh CLI for terminal
ssh CLI for terminals. Maybe a application later......

for now I want to write this thing with rust.

Below are what I think.

1. change different rsa keys for different entries, and save credentials with encoding.(while maybe I would not add the encoding functions at this very beginning.)
2. ssh......Maybe it's a good idea to put one inside this in case some systems don't install the ssh originally.
3. cross-platform key synchronisation, I can write one of ip I suppose.
4. export credentials with json format incase computer reset.

Future development?

Nah.

maybe a interface, and a portable server?

I'm not good at web and anything about interface.
